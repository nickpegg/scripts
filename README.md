# Random scripts

Random personal scripts that I keep in my ~/bin directory. 

## dock
Do steps required when I dock/undock my laptop at home:

1. Enable external monitor
1. Set default audio output to dock device (external speakers)

## sync_scripts
Inspired by @akerl's `script_sync`, links scripts from this repo into ~/bin.
